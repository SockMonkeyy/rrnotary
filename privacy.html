<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">

<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>We use different methods to collect information from and about you including through:</p>
<ul>
<li>DIRECT INTERACTIONS. You may give us your Identity, Demographic, Contact, Financial, Profile, or Marketing and Communications Information by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by mail, phone, email, or otherwise. This includes Personal Information you provide when you:
<ul>
<li>purchase our products or services;</li>
<li>create an account on our Websites;</li>
<li>subscribe to emails or newsletters;</li>
<li>request services or other information;</li>
<li>enter a competition, promotion or survey; or</li>
<li>give us feedback about products, services, or Websites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGIES OR INTERACTIONS.- As you navigate through the Websites, we may automatically collect Technical, Usage, and Location Information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. We collect this Personal Information by using cookies, pixel tags, embedded scripts, and other similar technologies. [We may also receive Technical Information about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies.]</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>COOKIES – Cookies are small data files that a website sends to your device while you are viewing the website that is stored on the device. Cookies can be used for many purposes, including to monitor the use of websites, to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to speed up your searches and purchases, and to recognize you when you return to our Websites and/or store your user name and password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Websites. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Websites or our content may not function properly.</li>
<li>PIXEL TAG – Pixel Tags (also referred to as clear GIFs, 1×1 GIFs Web beacons, or Web bugs) are small graphic images or other web programming code that may be included on the Websites and in our e-mail messages. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s Device, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a pixel tag. Pixel Tags or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Websites, to monitor how users navigate the Websites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</li>
<li>EMBEDDED SCRIPTS – Embedded scripts are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Websites, such as the links you click. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, and is active only while you are connected to the Websites.</li>
<li>FLASH LSOS – When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “flash cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please visit:</li>
</ul>
<p>HTTP://WWW.MACROMEDIA.COM/SUPPORT/DOCUMENTATION/EN/FLASHPLAYER/HE LP/SETTINGS_MANAGER07.HTML.</p>
<ul>
<li>COMMUNITY FEATURES. The Websites may provide you the opportunity to participate and post User Content publicly through reviews, surveys, interactive features, or other communication functionality (“Community Features”). We may provide functionality for you to submit or post User Content through Community Features, by linking the Websites to a third-party service, or otherwise. Please note that certain information, such as your name, may be publicly displayed on the Websites along with your User Content. User Content consisting of uploaded files may contain metadata, which may contain Personal Information or other information about or relating to you. You may wish to remove metadata from your files before transmitting such files to RR Notary Services LLC. NOTE THAT ANYTHING YOU POST THROUGH COMMUNITY FEATURES IS PUBLIC – OTHERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR USER CONTENT AND MAY USE IT OR SHARE IT WITH THIRD PARTIES. IF YOU CHOOSE TO VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION, THAT INFORMATION WILL BE CONSIDERED PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THE PROTECTIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY WILL NOT APPLY. IF YOU SUBMIT USER CONTENT, IT MAY BE PUBLISHED ONLINE OR OFFLINE AT ANY TIME. IN ADDITION, WE MAY USE YOUR USER CONTENT AND ANY EXCERPT FROM YOUR USER CONTENT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ADVERTISING, MARKETING, PUBLICITY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES.</li>
<li>THIRD PARTIES OR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES. We may receive Personal Information about you from various third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from us, the other website will forward your Contact Information and other information to us so that we may contact you as requested. We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services, or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Websites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information. Examples of third-party sources include:
<ul>
<li>Technical Information from the following parties: ○ analytics providers; ○ advertising networks; and ○ search information.</li>
<li>Contact, Financial and Transaction Information from providers of technical, payment, and delivery services.</li>
<li>Identity and Contact Information from publicly available sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>INFORMATION PROVIDED FROM OTHER USERS. If you decide to invite a third party to create an account and/or purchase our merchandise, we will collect the Identity and Contact Information you provide (e.g., name and e-mail address) for you and the third party in order to send a message to the third party and follow up with the third party. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to collect such information and contact the third party as described in the foregoing sentence. You or the third party may contact us at contact@rrnotaryservices.com to request the removal of this information from our database.</li>

<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>Certain functionality on the Websites may permit interactions that you initiate between the Websites and a third-party website or service (“THIRD PARTY INTERACTIONS”). Examples of Third Party Interactions may include technology that enables you to “like” or “share” content from the Websites on or to other websites or services; to transmit content to the Websites from your account on a third-party website or service; to otherwise connect the Websites to a third-party website or service, such as through an application programming interface (API) made available by RR Notary Services LLC or a third party; or for users to register for an account and login through social networking sites such as Facebook and Google (each an “SNS”). By registering or logging in through an SNS, you are allowing the Websites to access your information and you are agreeing to the SNS’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy in your use of such services. We may receive information from the SNS to make it easier for you to create an account with us. Any information that we collect from Your SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices.</p>
<p>If you choose to use Third Party Interactions, the information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Websites or by the provider of the Social Feature that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party platform that references the Websites (e.g., by mentioning one of the Websites or using a hashtag associated with one of the Websites in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on our Websites in accordance with the terms of the third-party website or service. Also, both RR Notary Services LLC and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Websites and the third-party website or service. In addition, we may receive information about you in connection with other users’ use of Third Party Interactions (e.g., we may learn that you are a “friend” or “connection” of the third party or receive other information about you that the other user enables us to receive). The information we collect in connection with Third-Party Interactions is subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share</p>
<p>information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service.</p>

<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>RR Notary Services LLC works with certain third parties (including network advertisers, ad agencies, and analytics companies) to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Websites, to serve advertisements, including our advertisements elsewhere online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Websites and the effectiveness of our advertisements.</p>
<p>These third parties may use Device Identifier and Usage Data to compile reports on user activity. For example, if you clicked on one of our advertisements that led you to one of the Websites, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, embedded scripts, and pixel tags) and may otherwise collect or have access to your Device Identifier, Usage Data, and related information about you. Cookies and pixel tags, including those set by third-party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you, and assist in providing analytics. These third parties may also transfer Device Identifier and Usage Data to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process analytics information on their behalf. Each of these third party’s ability to use and share Device Identifier and Usage Data is restricted by their respective Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Websites, you consent to the processing of data about you by these third parties in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of third-party analytics services, please contact us at contact@rrnotaryservices.com.</p>
<p>We may share Device Identifier and Usage Data about visitors with third-party advertising companies, analytics providers, and other vendors for similar purposes. While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, some of these companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>
<p>For additional information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members and DAA Self-Regulatory Program participating companies, you may visit:</p>

<p>Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served to advertise. You will continue to receive generic ads while visiting the Websites and elsewhere online. Some third parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different websites.</p>
<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. However, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.

<p>References to “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy are equivalent to “Personal Data” governed by European data protection legislation.</p>
<p>B. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA</p>
<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to do so. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Information in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where we need to perform obligations relating to a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</li>
<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Our legitimate interests include those related to conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</li>
<li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>

You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us using the contact information provided above.</p>
<p>We have set out below, in a table format, a description of the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate. Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data.</p>
<p>C. CONTROLLER</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of contact@rrnotaryservices.com.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact us using the details set out below.</p>
<ol>
<li>DATA RETENTION</li>
</ol>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data: see the Request Erasure subsection below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</li>
</ol>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis that allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<ol>
<li>EU RESIDENT PERSONAL DATA RIGHTS</li>
</ol>
<p>Under certain circumstances, EU Residents may have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data as outlined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>REQUEST ACCESS to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
<li>REQUEST CORRECTION of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
<li>REQUEST ERASURE of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons that will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
<li>OBJECT TO PROCESSING of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it affects your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.</li>
<li>REQUEST RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
<li>REQUEST THE TRANSFER of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
<li>WITHDRAW CONSENT at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact contact@rrnotaryservices.com.</p>
<p>No Fee Usually Required</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>What We May Need From You</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>Time Limit To Respond</p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p>Complaints to Supervisory Authority</p>
<p>EU Residents may have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues. However, we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority so please first contact us directly to allow us to do so.</p>
